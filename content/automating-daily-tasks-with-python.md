# Automating Daily Tasks with Python: A Beginner's Guide

Have you ever wished to automate repetitive tasks and make your daily routine more efficient? Python, a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language, is the perfect tool for the job. In this guide, we'll explore some simple Python scripts to automate common tasks and demonstrate the power of programming in your everyday life.

## Setting Up Your Python Environment

Before we dive into the examples, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once installed, open your terminal or command prompt and let's get started!

### Example 1: Renaming Files in a Directory

```python
import os

def rename_files(directory_path, prefix):
    for filename in os.listdir(directory_path):
        if filename.startswith(prefix):
            new_name = filename.replace(prefix, f"{prefix}_new")
            os.rename(os.path.join(directory_path, filename), os.path.join(directory_path, new_name))

# Example Usage
rename_files("/path/to/your/directory", "file_prefix")
```

This simple Python script renames all files in a given directory that start with a specified prefix. You can customize the directory_path and prefix variables to suit your needs.

### Example 2: Sending Automated Emails

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

def send_email(subject, message, to_email):
    # Set up the email server
    server = smtplib.SMTP("your_smtp_server.com", 587)
    server.starttls()
    server.login("your_email@gmail.com", "your_email_password")

    # Compose the email
    email_body = MIMEText(message)
    email_body["Subject"] = subject
    email_body["From"] = "your_email@gmail.com"
    email_body["To"] = to_email

    # Send the email
    server.sendmail("your_email@gmail.com", to_email, email_body.as_string())

    # Close the server connection
    server.quit()

# Example Usage
send_email("Automated Greeting", "Hello from your Python script!", "recipient@example.com")


```

This script sends a simple automated email using the smtplib library. Adjust the server details, login credentials, and email content according to your email provider.

### Conclusion

These examples are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to automating tasks with Python. As you explore the language further, you'll discover countless possibilities for simplifying your daily routine through programming.
