In an exclusive interview with the developer of an amazing game, we dive into the world of "Shooting Genjitsu," an upcoming anime-themed multiplayer game crafted by the talented game developer, Ishan Maduranga. Let's explore the journey, development insights, and exciting features of this promising game.

## Getting to Know Ishan Maduranga

Ishan Maduranga, currently pursuing a Master's in Artificial Intelligence at Dublin Business School (DBS) in Ireland, serves as the visionary force behind the creation of "Shooting Genjitsu." Residing near the vibrant city of Dublin, Ishan's academic journey commenced with a degree in cybersecurity management. However, the monotony of repetitive tasks led him to explore the dynamic realm of programming, ultimately delving into the fascinating realms of AI and machine learning.

Driven by a childhood dream, Ishan's passion for game development took root. While mastering AI programming, he harbored the ambition to craft his own game—a dream inspired by immersive experiences with shooter games such as Call of Duty, CS:GO, and Valorant. The influence of the shooter genre, particularly the satisfaction derived from playing COD 4, fueled Ishan's determination to create an equally gratifying gaming experience. His gaming influences extended beyond FPS-type games to include a fondness for the unique dynamics of TPS games like PUBG, where the combination of powers adds a distinct flavor.

In summary, Ishan Maduranga's diverse background, fueled by academic pursuits, gaming influences, and a deep appreciation for anime, converges in the development of "Shooting Genjitsu." His journey underscores the fusion of technical expertise, childhood dreams, and a passion for creating an immersive gaming venture.

## The Genesis of "Shooting Genjitsu"

Inspired by a love for anime, Ishan Maduranga set out on a creative journey to bring the captivating world of anime into the realm of gaming. His idea was simple yet innovative: blend the excitement of shooting games with the beautiful art of anime, offering players a fresh and unique multiplayer gaming experience.

"Shooting Genjitsu" isn't just a game; it's Ishan's way of combining the best of both worlds—exciting gameplay and the vibrant visuals of anime. This game is a result of his dedication to delivering something special, a gaming adventure that captures the storytelling charm of anime while keeping the thrill of shooting games. The beginning of this unique gaming experience is all about combining artistic inspiration with a desire to offer something new.

## Development Tech: Embracing Unreal Engine 5

In the realm of game development, Ishan Maduranga made a strategic choice by adopting Unreal Engine 5 as the platform for crafting "Shooting Genjitsu." Here's a closer look at why he opted for this powerhouse of a development tool:

### **Open-Source Advantage**

Unreal Engine 5's open-source nature provides Ishan with the flexibility and freedom essential for his creative process. The ability to customize and tailor the engine to fit the specific needs of "Shooting Genjitsu" is a key factor in its development.

### **Cutting-Edge Technologies**

The engine's incorporation of advanced technologies such as FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution) and ray tracing significantly elevates the visual and gaming experience. These features contribute to creating a more immersive world within the game.

### **Efficient C++ Programming**

Ishan underscores the efficiency of C++ programming within Unreal Engine 5. Leveraging this high-level programming language allows for optimal performance, crucial for a solo developer aiming to create a seamless and engaging gaming experience.

### **Nanite: A Time-Saving Asset**

A standout feature for Ishan is Nanite, a revolutionary technology in Unreal Engine 5. This dynamic virtualized micropolygon geometry system not only enhances visual fidelity but also saves valuable development time. For a solo developer like Ishan, Nanite proves to be an invaluable asset, streamlining the process of bringing his creative vision to life.

In essence, the choice of Unreal Engine 5 goes beyond a mere preference; it's a strategic decision rooted in the engine's open-source nature, advanced technologies, efficient programming capabilities, and time-saving features like Nanite.

## Gameplay Teasers: Free for All and Beyond

The below video is a play test of Ishan's latest game which he tried out with his friends. Most of the parts of the game are still under development.

Currently, "Shooting Genjitsu" offers a Free for All (FFA) mode, with plans to introduce a Team Death Match (TDM) mode in the future. Ishan envisions providing players with a modern gaming experience, enriched by unique in-game powers, opening up diverse strategies for victory.

## Artistic Touch: Anime-Themed Characters

To maintain the anime theme, Ishan employs post-processing shaders within Unreal Engine, creating a toon-like appearance for characters. The game's title, "Shooting Genjitsu," translates to "reality" or "facts" in Japanese, capturing the essence of blending reality with anime elements.

## Future Plans and Launch Windows

While Ishan targets a January release, he plans to unveil the game for wishlisting on Steam by mid-December. As the game progresses, players can anticipate announcements, including teaser trailers and expected launch windows.

## System Requirements and Monetization

For optimal gameplay, Ishan provides the minimum specs and assures ongoing optimization for lower-end hardware. "Shooting Genjitsu" will be available on Steam, embracing a free-to-play model with reliance on donations and crowdfunding for support.

## Collaboration and the Sri Lankan Game Development Scene

Reflecting on the Sri Lankan gaming industry, Ishan acknowledges room for improvement, emphasizing the importance of focusing on engaging gameplay mechanics rather than solely on graphics. While "Shooting Genjitsu" marks Ishan's first solo endeavor, he envisions future games with collaborative efforts. We wish the best for Ishan's future as a game developer and we hope that he will be able to shine the name of Sri Lanka with his artistic approach to game development.
