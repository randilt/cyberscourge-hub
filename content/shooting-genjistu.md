Let's explore the journey, development insights, and exciting features of this promising game.

## Getting to Know Ishan Maduranga

Ishan Maduranga, a current Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at DBS, Ireland, is the creative mind behind "Shooting Genjitsu." With a background in cyber security management, Ishan's journey into game development was fueled by a childhood dream and a passion for shooter games like Call of Duty, CS:GO, and Valorant.

As an avid anime enthusiast, Ishan drew inspiration from the captivating world of anime to create a unique gaming experience. The idea was born out of a desire to merge the excitement of shooting games with the rich aesthetics of anime, providing a fresh take on multiplayer gaming.

## Development Tech: Unreal Engine 5 and Beyond

Choosing Unreal Engine 5 as the development platform, Ishan explains its appeal with its open-source nature, advanced technologies like FSR and ray tracing, and the efficiency of C++ programming. He emphasizes the advantages, including the time-saving benefits of Unreal Engine 5's Nanite, a valuable asset for a solo developer.

## Gameplay Teasers: Free for All and Beyond

Currently, "Shooting Genjitsu" offers a Free for All (FFA) mode, with plans to introduce a Team Death Match (TDM) mode in the future. Ishan envisions providing players with a modern gaming experience, enriched by unique in-game powers, opening up diverse strategies for victory.

## Artistic Touch: Anime-Themed Characters

To maintain the anime theme, Ishan employs post-processing shaders within Unreal Engine, creating a toon-like appearance for characters. The game's title, "Shooting Genjitsu," translates to "reality" or "facts" in Japanese, capturing the essence of blending reality with anime elements.

## Future Plans and Launch Windows

While Ishan targets a January release, he plans to unveil the game for wishlisting on Steam by mid-December. As the game progresses, players can anticipate announcements, including teaser trailers and expected launch windows.

## System Requirements and Monetization

For optimal gameplay, Ishan provides the minimum specs and assures ongoing optimization for lower-end hardware. "Shooting Genjitsu" will be available on Steam, embracing a free-to-play model with reliance on donations and crowdfunding for support.

## Collaboration and the Sri Lankan Game Development Scene

Reflecting on the Sri Lankan gaming industry, Ishan acknowledges room for improvement, emphasizing the importance of focusing on engaging gameplay mechanics rather than solely on graphics. While "Shooting Genjitsu" marks Ishan's first solo endeavor, he envisions future games with collaborative efforts.
