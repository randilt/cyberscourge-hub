# Python Conditional Statements

Greetings programming enthusiasts. Today we are gonna give you a deep dive about python **if else** statements.

Before learning about pythons if else statements, you have to be familiar with the usual ***logical conditions.***

## Python Logical Conditions

- ==   **equal** operator.

example:

```python
a = 5
b = 5
print(a == b) #returns true

c = 6
d = 9
print(c == d) #returns false
```

-  **&gt;** &nbsp; **greater than** operator
- **&lt;** &nbsp; **less than** operator

example:
```python 
a = 20
b = 35
print(b > a) #returns true
print(a > b) #returns false
print(a < b) #returns true
print(b < a) #returns false
```


-  **&gt;=** &nbsp; **greater or equal** operator

- **&lt;=**  &nbsp; **less than or equal** operator

```python
c = 25
d = 25
e = 35
f = 15

print(c >= e) #returns true since c is greater than e
print(c >= d) #returns true since c is equal to e
print(f <= c) #returns true since f is less than c
print(c <= d) #returns true since c is equal to d
print(c <= f) #returns false
```


## Conditional Statements


 - Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a given condition is **true** or **false**. 

This is how it follows 

```python

if condition: 
	# if the condition is true, run this code 

else: 
	# if the condition is false run this code 
```


here is a simple example.

```python
A = 5 
B =  7 
if A > B:  #checks whether the A is greater than B  
	print('A is greater than B')  # runs this if the above condition is true.  

else: 
	Print('B is greater than A')   #runs this if the above condition is false.  

```

In this case, this code block gets executed since A > B is **false** (A is 5 and B is 7) 

```python
'B is greater than A'
```


Here is another example. 
```python
age = int(input('Enter your age: ')) # gets the age as an input from the user and convert it into a number type 
if age >= 18:   # checks the age the user gave as input is greater or equal to 18 
    print('You are eligible to vote.')  
else:  
    print('You are not eligible to vote yet.') 
```

If you enter any number that is equal or greater than 18 as the input (**lets say 25**) you get this output

```markdown
You are eligible to vote
```



If you enter any number that is less than 18 as the input (**lets say 15**) you get this output 

```markdown
You are not eligible to vote 
```





 - ## elif Statement 

The **elif** statement allows you to check multiple conditions sequentially, and if the preceding **if** or **elif** conditions are not satisfied, the block of code associated with the **first true condition is executed.** 

 ```python
 if condition1:  
    # Code to execute if condition1 is true 
elif condition2:  
    # Code to execute if condition2 is true  
elif condition3:  
    # Code to execute if condition3 is true  
else: 
    # Code to execute if none of the above conditions are true 
```





**Here is a simple example** 

```python
# Assume some variable
grade = 85
# Check different conditions using if, elif, and else
if grade >= 90:
    print("A")
elif grade >= 80:
    print("B")
elif grade >= 70:
    print("C")
elif grade >= 60:
    print("D")
else:
    print("F")
```
